      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>My name is Nasser. I am a third-year student at PMU; I joined the university back in 2022 for the purpose of learning and developing, especially in the engineering field. I specialize in mechanical engineering, which I have loved ever since I was a little kid.</p>
      <p>What really got me into loving the engineering world is muscle cars! I loved how well-shaped they are and of course the loud noise they make. So, I started to look into the engineering aspects and the different components of muscle cars and how different they are from other types of cars.</p>
      <p>After graduating high school, I joined Aramco as a trainee where I studied mathematics, English, and many other subjects related to my work — including pipe fitting and oil and gas operations. These were heavily associated with engineering, so I can confidently say I was well-informed and educated before becoming an employee.</p>
      <p>What really sealed the deal for me was working with engineers after signing my contract with Aramco. My work is deeply tied to engineering, and I communicate daily with petroleum and mechanical engineers to solve issues safely and efficiently.</p>
      <p>Today, after three years of continuous learning at PMU, I can confidently say I strive to be the best version of myself. PMU has taught me essential professional skills that will help me grow as a future and current leader.</p>

    <section id="goals" class="tab-content">
        <img src="goals.png">
      <h2>Professional Goals</h2>
      <h3>Short-Term Goals</h3>
      <p>As a student, I always aim to leave the classroom with new knowledge and experiences. Each class offers opportunities, and it is my duty as a mechanical engineering student to develop the right skills to seize them. I aim to apply what I’ve learned at PMU in my professional role as an oil and gas operation coordinator at Saudi Aramco.</p>
      <p>Courses like critical thinking, leadership, and professional development have helped me grow as a leader. One short-term goal is identifying missing components that could improve my workplace. Applying university knowledge makes this journey clearer and more achievable.</p>
      <p>Another short-term goal is academic excellence. I prioritize passing each class with the highest grade possible by attending regularly, participating actively, studying daily, submitting assignments on time, and helping fellow students — because I believe good deeds always return.</p>

      <h3>Long-Term Goals</h3>
      <p>In the long run, I aim to build my own engineering consulting and development company. I also dream of opening a workshop specializing in fixing, building, and upgrading automobiles — especially muscle cars — to become the most trusted name in the field.</p>
      <p>I’m determined to earn my master’s and PhD degrees. I believe learning and development are lifelong journeys, and there’s always room for improvement. One of my biggest goals is to become a skilled mechanical engineer who contributes to a better future.</p>
      <p>With technology evolving rapidly — cars, airplanes, ships, and trains becoming futuristic — I aim to be part of the innovation that shapes the next 50 years. I will try my hardest to make the world better through engineering.</p>

  <h2>Technology</h2>

  <h3>Definition</h3>
  <p>
    Technology refers to digital tools and systems designed to improve productivity, communication, research, and daily problem-solving. It allows people to access large amounts of information quickly and helps students complete assignments more efficiently. Through IT tools such as computers, search engines, and different educational applications, learners can make better decisions and evaluate information more carefully. Technology also encourages creativity and innovation, especially when working on academic tasks that require collecting data or analyzing results. As technology keeps developing, students must continue improving their digital skills to perform well in school and adapt to modern professional environments.
  </p>

  <h3>Reflection on 1st Assignment</h3>
  <p>
    During the Music and Mental Health assignment in my Writing and Research course, I developed skills related to Technology Competency, especially the indicator that focuses on using IT tools for productivity, communication, research, problem-solving, and decision-making. The assignment required me to explore how music can affect mental health both positively and negatively. To do this effectively, I used online search engines like Google, academic platforms such as ResearchGate, and different websites to gather accurate and deep information.
  </p>
  <p>
    I consider my performance to be at an Intermediate level because I was able to search for useful content and evaluate which sources were trustworthy, although I believe there is still room to improve. I faced several challenges such as time management issues and dealing with unreliable websites that provided weak information. I also struggled slightly with organizing the large amount of data I found. To overcome those challenges, I started using note-taking strategies, checking the credibility of authors, and managing my time better by planning the research process step by step.
  </p>
  <p>
    This assignment enhanced my ability to think critically and improved my research confidence. It also helped me understand how easily people can be misled by incorrect information if they do not verify it. My advice to other students who will do a similar assignment is to always search from trusted academic sources and avoid copying information without checking if it is correct. Staying organized and using technology wisely can make research easier and more professional. Overall, this assignment helped strengthen my understanding of technology and showed me how digital tools can help in learning new knowledge about mental health and society.
  </p>

  <h3>Reflection on 2nd Assignment</h3>
  <p>
    The second assignment, Lab Questionnaires Format, was completed in my Healthy Behavior and Management course and also helped me apply Technology Competency, especially the success indicator of using IT tools for productivity, communication, research, problem-solving, and decision-making. The purpose of the task was to evaluate my personal health, lifestyle, and fitness through digital questionnaires and then organize the results using technology.
  </p>
  <p>
    I rate my performance as Intermediate because I managed to finish the assignment successfully, but I still needed to learn more about how to format results correctly and use technology more efficiently. One of the main challenges I faced was dealing with technical problems and not fully understanding how to structure the data at the beginning. Time management was also a difficulty since I had to learn while completing the task.
  </p>
  <p>
    To overcome these issues, I searched for tutorials online, asked others for help when needed, and experimented with different technology features until I understood them better. Through this assignment, I gained useful knowledge about how technology is used in the health field to analyze behavior and make better decisions about personal well-being. It made me appreciate how digital tools can give a clearer and more organized view of a person’s health.
  </p>
  <p>
    My advice for students who will do a similar assignment is to not be afraid of technology use because practice will make it easier and faster. Learning to depend on technology for problem-solving is important because it helps improve accuracy and allows us to make smarter decisions about our health. This assignment helped me develop confidence in using technology and encouraged me to improve my skills for future academic and personal tasks.

  <h2>Leadership</h2>

  Leadership Definition
  <!-- <div class="leadership-definition"> -->
    <h3>Leadership Definition</h3>
    <p>
      Leadership is when a person can guide and motivate others to reach a shared goal. 
      A strong leader doesn’t just tell people what to do but works with them and sets a good example. 
      Leadership means inspiring others, communicating clearly, and helping the team stay focused. 
      It also involves making smart decisions, solving problems, and understanding people’s feelings. 
      A real leader cares about helping everyone improve and succeed together. 
      Whether it’s at school, work, or in daily life, leadership is about taking responsibility, 
      showing respect, and always trying to make things better for the whole group.
    </p>

  <!-- Reflection Paragraph on 1st Assignment -->
  <!-- <div class="reflection"> -->
    <h3>Reflection on 1st Assignment</h3>
    <p>
      In the Leadership and Teamwork course, one of the main assignments I completed was called 
      <strong>Leadership Styles and Types</strong>, which relates to the Leadership Competency and the indicator 
      <em>Offers vision and purpose that inspires others</em>. My performance level for this assignment was Intermediate. 
      This assignment had three main questions, and the first one asked me to choose a leader who shows good leadership traits. 
      I selected Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of Facebook, which he started back in 2004. 
      I wrote about his leadership styles, how he inspires others, and how he manages his company. 
      The second question was about choosing my own leadership style, and I selected Servant Leadership because I believe in 
      leading by serving and supporting my team members. I explained how I manage my team at work, how I push them to do better, 
      and how I care for others’ success. From this assignment, I learned more about what it means to be a true leader and how 
      different leadership styles can affect team motivation and performance.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the assignment, I faced some obstacles such as time management, team conflict, and coordination issues, 
      especially while trying to describe my own leadership experiences. I overcame these challenges by having better communication 
      with my team and assigning one member to help with coordination, which improved our time management. 
      This experience taught me the importance of planning, communication, and empathy in leadership. 
      I believe my Intermediate level performance shows that I have a good understanding of leadership but still have more to develop 
      in inspiring others consistently. My advice to other students is to always reflect on their personal experiences when learning 
      about leadership styles, because it helps connect theory to real life and makes the topic more meaningful.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- Reflection Paragraph on 2nd Assignment -->
  <!-- <div class="reflection"> -->
    <h3>Reflection on 2nd Assignment</h3>
    <p>
      The second assignment I completed for the Leadership and Teamwork course was called 
      <strong>Strength-Based Leadership</strong>, which is also related to the Leadership Competency and the indicator 
      <em>Effectively plans and organizes projects</em>. My performance level in this assignment was Intermediate. 
      The assignment was about understanding the concept of strength-based leadership, which focuses on identifying and developing 
      the strengths of individuals in a team to improve overall performance. I learned that when a leader focuses on people’s strengths 
      instead of weaknesses, the team becomes more motivated, productive, and confident. This assignment helped me understand how to 
      apply these ideas in my workplace by recognizing what each team member does best and organizing tasks accordingly. 
      Through this, I learned important leadership skills such as pushing the team toward success, managing tasks effectively, 
      and caring for others’ growth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some challenges I faced were time management, communication, and coordination with my teammates. 
      These challenges sometimes caused delays or misunderstandings about task distribution. 
      I overcame them by having open conversations with my team about the conflicts we faced and by assigning one person to handle 
      coordination, which helped improve our planning and organization. This process also taught me how important it is for a leader 
      to listen, adapt, and plan clearly. I believe my Intermediate performance shows that I am growing as a leader and learning how 
      to manage projects in a more effective and organized way. My advice to others is to always focus on their strengths and the strengths 
      of people around them, because leadership is not about controlling others—it’s about guiding and helping everyone to do their best together.

<section id="teamwork" class="tab-content">
  <h2>Teamwork</h2>

  <h3>Definition</h3>
  <p>
    Teamwork is the collaborative process in which individuals with different skills, perspectives, and responsibilities work together toward a shared goal. Effective teamwork requires clear communication, mutual respect, and accountability for individual contributions to support overall success. It involves coordinating efforts, resolving conflicts constructively, and making joint decisions that reflect the interests of the entire group. Team members contribute their strengths, help one another overcome weaknesses, and create an environment that encourages trust and commitment. Through cooperation and shared responsibility, teamwork enhances productivity, improves problem-solving, and promotes learning experiences that lead to stronger outcomes than those achieved individually.
  </p>

  <h3>Reflection on 1st Assignment</h3>
  <p>
    In the Strength-Based Leadership group presentation from the Leadership and Teamwork course, I focused on the Teamwork Competency and the indicator of success which is using effective interpersonal and group process skills. My performance level for this competency is intermediate. This assignment required identifying my own unique strengths and talents through self-reflection and assessment tools, as well as understanding how my personal values and motivations shape my leadership approach. I had to collaborate closely with my group to complete the project and prepare a clear presentation on how strengths-based leadership improves team performance.
  </p>
  <p>
    During this assignment, I learned how important it is to recognize individual abilities within the group in order to divide tasks effectively. Working in a team allowed me to practice communication skills, active listening, and the willingness to support others while also taking responsibility for my own part. A major benefit of this assignment was gaining confidence to speak up and share ideas that contributed to the overall success of the presentation. The experience strengthened my understanding that leadership does not always mean taking charge, but can also mean encouraging teammates to use their strengths to achieve a shared goal.
  </p>
  <p>
    The biggest obstacle I faced in this assignment was gathering all group members at the same time to work on our material. Everyone had different schedules, which made coordination difficult. To overcome this, we focused on smart and effective time management by using online communication tools and dividing tasks so each member could complete his part individually before we met to combine everything. I believe I performed at the intermediate level because I demonstrated good teamwork, communication, and contribution, although I still need to improve my confidence in leading discussions and making quicker decisions. This assignment helped me understand that teamwork requires patience, flexibility, and appreciation of everyone’s strengths in order to succeed.
  </p>

  <h3>Reflection on 2nd Assignment</h3>
  <p>
    In the Intercultural Roommate Conflict group presentation from the Oral Communication course, the focus was again on the Teamwork Competency and the indicator of success which is using effective interpersonal and group process skills. I evaluated my performance level as intermediate. This assignment discussed a conflict scenario between three roommates from Saudi Arabia, Japan, and the United States who struggled with their different cultural values and beliefs. As a group, we analyzed the misunderstanding and developed a solution by applying teamwork, respect, and communication strategies.
  </p>
  <p>
    Through this assignment, I learned how teamwork plays an important role in solving conflicts, especially when cultural differences are involved. We had to work together to understand each culture’s perspective and find a fair compromise. This taught me not to judge others quickly and instead take time to listen to their reasoning. The assignment also improved my skills in public speaking, responsibility sharing, and communicating clearly with teammates while preparing for the presentation. It demonstrated that effective teamwork requires open-mindedness and proper conflict-resolution techniques.
  </p>
  <p>
    The main obstacle we faced was finding a suitable time to gather the entire group and complete our tasks. Coordinating schedules was stressful, but we overcame this challenge through smart planning, dividing responsibilities, and communicating regularly so that each member finished their work on time. I believe my performance was at an intermediate level because I contributed well and supported my teammates, although I still want to grow in expressing my ideas more confidently and taking more initiative during group decisions. This assignment helped me understand that teamwork is essential when dealing with different viewpoints and that successful conflict resolution depends on mutual respect, cooperation, and strong communication among all team members.

  <h2>Critical Thinking</h2>

  <h3>Definition</h3>
  <p>
    Critical Thinking is the process of analyzing information objectively, evaluating evidence, and making reasoned judgments based on logic rather than emotion or bias. It involves gathering and processing information, clarifying problems, and developing effective solutions through reflection and evidence-based reasoning. A person with strong critical thinking skills can identify assumptions, evaluate arguments, and draw balanced conclusions after examining multiple perspectives. This competency is essential for academic success, workplace decisions, and daily problem-solving, as it encourages logical, fair, and well-supported conclusions.
  </p>

  <h3>Reflection on 1st Assignment</h3>
  <p>
    The assignment titled <strong>Social Media Effects on Human Communication</strong> was part of the <strong>Critical Thinking and Problem-Solving</strong> course and focused on the <strong>Critical Thinking Competency Indicator 1 – Gathers and Processes Information for Decision-Making</strong>. My performance level in this assignment was <strong>Intermediate</strong>. The activity required teamwork and a structured presentation in which my classmates and I engaged in a debate about how social media impacts human communication. Some team members argued that social media enhances global connectivity, while others believed it weakens genuine interaction and reduces the quality of face-to-face communication.
  </p>
  <p>
    This assignment helped me strengthen my ability to analyze diverse opinions, evaluate the credibility of information, and support claims with logical evidence. I learned how to organize arguments, distinguish between facts and assumptions, and make informed decisions based on reliable sources rather than emotions or popularity. In preparing for this assignment, I researched several academic articles and communication studies that discussed how digital platforms influence social interaction patterns. This research process taught me the importance of using peer-reviewed and credible sources rather than depending on social media opinions.
  </p>
  <p>
    Working collaboratively also developed my communication and leadership skills because I had to mediate conflicting viewpoints and keep the discussion respectful and productive. One difficulty I faced was managing the differences in perspectives among my group members, as some were strongly opinionated and dismissive of opposing views. I overcame this by practicing active listening and encouraging a balanced discussion where every argument was supported with data or real-life examples. Another challenge was maintaining consistency in the flow of the presentation, as each member had a different communication style. To overcome this, I created an outline and shared presentation guidelines that helped unify our slides and talking points.
  </p>
  <p>
    Through this, I learned the importance of maintaining neutrality and focusing on evidence-based reasoning. Overall, this assignment improved my decision-making and communication skills by teaching me to critically assess information before forming conclusions. My advice to future students is to keep an open mind, use credible academic sources, practice teamwork, and base all conclusions on evidence rather than assumptions or emotions.
  </p>

  <h3>Reflection on 2nd Assignment</h3>
  <p>
    The second assignment, titled <strong>Evaluation of Arguments for and Against Capital Punishment</strong>, was also part of the <strong>Critical Thinking and Problem-Solving</strong> course and connected to the <strong>Critical Thinking Competency Indicator 2 – Develops and Reasonably Defends Arguments, Decisions, and Positions</strong>. My performance level was <strong>Intermediate</strong>. This assignment required me to examine multiple viewpoints regarding capital punishment, focusing on both the arguments for and against it. It enhanced my ability to construct balanced arguments, evaluate opposing viewpoints, and defend my position logically with strong reasoning and evidence.
  </p>
  <p>
    Through this assignment, I learned how to apply critical evaluation and ethical reasoning to make fair judgments about morally complex topics. I researched statistics on wrongful executions, legal case studies, and moral theories like utilitarianism to support my arguments. By doing so, I realized that the death penalty debate is not simply about justice but about accuracy, fairness, and human rights.
  </p>
  <p>
    One difficulty I faced was maintaining objectivity while addressing such a sensitive issue. It was easy to let personal emotions influence my stance, but I made a conscious effort to rely only on credible research sources, statistical data, and academic references to support every claim I made. Another challenge was organizing the arguments clearly so the reader could easily follow the reasoning. To address this, I used an outline that separated ethical, social, and legal perspectives, allowing my discussion to stay structured and focused.
  </p>
  <p>
    This approach taught me the value of presenting balanced arguments and ensuring that each conclusion is drawn from logical evidence rather than emotion. This process also strengthened my ability to defend arguments with clarity and evaluate ethical dilemmas effectively. My final judgment leaned against the use of capital punishment, as the possibility of executing an innocent person outweighs the benefits of retribution.
  </p>
  <p>
    My advice for future students is to approach controversial topics with open-mindedness, use reliable evidence, and always ensure that arguments are logically structured and ethically sound, even when personal beliefs differ.

  <h2>Professionalism</h2>

  <h3>Definition</h3>
  <p>
    Professionalism means showing ethical behavior, honesty, and competence at school and work. It includes maintaining good work ethics, clear communication, respect for others, and improving skills over time. A professional also shows responsibility and accountability while adapting to new situations. Professionalism is about applying knowledge well, keeping a positive attitude, and making choices that are fair and respectful. It ensures that people contribute in a meaningful way and always meet high standards of conduct.
  </p>

  <h3>Reflection on 1st Assignment</h3>
  <p>
    In <strong>Career Development Models for Professional Development and Competencies</strong> course, I studied Negotiation, the components of negotiation, the value of self-awareness, and how this makes negotiation an art. I linked my work to <strong>Professionalism Competency Indicator 1 – Maintains a good work ethics</strong> and rated my performance level as <strong>Intermediate</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    This assignment showed me that good negotiation starts before the meeting. I learned to prepare by writing my goal, the facts I will use, and the trades I can accept. I also wrote what I cannot accept so I do not agree to something I will regret. Knowing my best alternative if the deal does not work (my backup plan) helped me feel calmer and more respectful in the talk.
  </p>
  <p>
    A big part of this task was simple but hard: I had to know myself. I asked, do I talk too fast? Do I avoid silence? Do I give in too early, or do I push too much? I thought about real moments from my life and asked a friend for honest feedback. That helped me see small habits that make a big difference, like pausing, listening first, and repeating what the other person said to show I heard them. I also practiced using clear and simple words instead of long speeches.
  </p>
  <p>
    The main difficulty was looking at my own mistakes. It does not feel good, but it helped me grow. I chose the Intermediate level because I can use the ideas and act with respect, yet I still need more real practice to balance being firm and being flexible. My advice to other students is to prepare on paper, keep talks friendly, and end with clear next steps. Say what both sides agreed to and when it will happen. Doing this builds trust and shows good work ethics.
  </p>
  <p>
    This assignment taught me that negotiation is not about winning or losing; it is about understanding needs, being fair, and finding a result that works for both sides. When I connect self-awareness with simple tools and honest behavior, my results improve and my relationships stay strong.
  </p>

  <h3>Reflection on 2nd Assignment</h3>
  <p>
    In <strong>Approaches to Conflict for Professional Development and Competencies</strong> course, I wrote about a personal experience with conflict, and how acceptance and learning from conflict can help growth. I linked my work to <strong>Professionalism Competency Indicator 4 – Improves and increases professional competency over time</strong> and rated my performance level as <strong>Intermediate</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    At first, I did not want to share a personal story. It felt too private. I solved this by writing only the parts that mattered: what happened, how I felt, what I did, and what I learned. I kept names and details out. This made me feel safe and still honest. I learned that conflict is not always bad. It can be a signal that something is unclear or unfair. When handled with respect, it can make a team stronger.
  </p>
  <p>
    In my case, the problem started because expectations were not clear. I assumed one thing and the other person assumed another. We were both frustrated. To fix this, I chose a quiet time to talk. I explained my view in simple words and then repeated their view back to them to show I understood. I asked what a good outcome would look like for both of us. We wrote down two small steps and a time to check in. This took the pressure down and moved us forward.
  </p>
  <p>
    The hardest part was managing emotions. I practiced taking a breath before I spoke and keeping my voice calm. I also used short sentences and asked open questions. This approach helped me listen more and react less. I rated myself Intermediate because I can handle many conflicts well, but I still need practice when time is short or feelings are strong.
  </p>
  <p>
    This assignment fits the idea of improving professional competency over time because each conflict teaches something new: how to listen, how to set clear agreements, and how to follow up. My advice is simple: do not fear conflict. Use it to learn. Be honest, be kind, and be clear. End every talk with a small plan that both sides understand. This keeps trust and shows professionalism in daily life.

<section id="communication" class="tab-content">
  <h2>Communication</h2>

  <h3>Definition</h3>
  <p>
    Communication is the process of sharing ideas, information, and messages via a variety of mediums, including written and spoken words as well as nonverbal clues. It entails having the capacity to obtain knowledge as well as communicating clearly, purposefully, and ethically both orally and in writing. People can comprehend one another, work together productively, and resolve issues in a variety of situations when they communicate well. Communication competency in academic and professional contexts guarantees that individuals can rationally express their ideas, honor cultural norms, and accomplish significant results in both collaborative and solo projects.
  </p>

  <h3>Reflection on 1st Assignment</h3>
  <p>
    The first assignment I selected is <strong>Strengths-Based Leadership</strong>, which comes from the Leadership course and is aligned with the Communication Competency. Since this assignment required me to produce a clear analysis and explanation of how leaders can find and develop individual capabilities within a team, it clearly relates to <strong>Indicator 4 – Prepares effective written and oral communication</strong>. I met the <strong>Intermediate</strong> level of performance requirements for this competency. Even though there is still need for improvement in order to reach Advanced-level communication, I think I showed that I could understand information, present it well, and back up my points with examples.
  </p>
  <p>
    This assignment concentrated on a leadership philosophy that emphasizes and builds upon both individual and team capabilities in order to enhance performance. This taught me the value of smart and upbeat communication, particularly when inspiring others. Finding the most effective approach to arrange my thoughts so they were distinct and not repetitious was one of the challenges I encountered. My manuscript initially felt disorganized, but I was able to get past this by making an outline and making multiple revisions until the message became clearer. I also practiced rephrasing my ideas to make them more concise and easier to understand.
  </p>
  <p>
    I became more aware of how crucial clarity is in business communication as a result. I advise readers to begin with an outline at all times and highlight writing and leadership skills since it conveys a positive and inspiring message. Although I was able to convey concepts clearly and produce high-quality content, I still need to improve my organization and flow in order to work at an advanced level, thus I rate my performance as intermediate.
  </p>

    Communication Competency is reflected in the second assignment I chose, <strong>Culture and Values on Arguments</strong>, which is taken from the Critical Thinking and Problem-Solving course. This assignment, which asked me to look at how culture and values affect communication in debates, negotiations, and decision-making, has a direct connection to <strong>Indicator 3 – Critically evaluate the quality of information in relation to need</strong>. I met the <strong>Intermediate</strong> level of performance requirements for this competency. This, in my opinion, was suitable as I could successfully understand and apply concepts; however, I still need to work on honing my capacity to modify my communication style for various cultural contexts.
  </p>
  <p>
    When attempting to reach an agreement or convince others, the assignment examined how cultural values influence how people debate, communicate, and negotiate. It showed me that audience cultural background is just as important to communication as the language used. Understanding viewpoints that differed from mine was one challenge I encountered, particularly when attempting to comprehend how particular values might influence someone to accept or reject particular arguments.
  </p>
  <p>
    I initially discovered that I was depending too much on my own experiences, but I was able to overcome this by looking out examples of cross-cultural communication and using them in my reflections. This method made it clearer to me how cultural alignment might determine whether communication is successful or not. Because what works in one culture might not work in another, I advise readers to constantly keep the cultural perspective of the person they are speaking with in mind.
  </p>
  <p>
    Since I could assess material well and apply it to real-world communication situations, I gave myself an intermediate rating. However, in order to grow, I need to get better at more flexibly changing my style.
